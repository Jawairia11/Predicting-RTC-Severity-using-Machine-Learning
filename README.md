## UK Governaments Road Accidents Data for preventative measures that could be implemented to prevent more deaths on UK roads.

# Predicting-RTC-Severity-using-Machine-Learning
By harnessing the power of Machine Learning we intend to predict the severity of RTCs and RTC hotspots which would allow the local authority to implement further traffic safety measures.

### PROJECT GOALS 
1. Classifying RTC severity. 2. Identifying areas with the highest number of RTCs. 3. Identifying what type of vehicles are involved in most RTCs. 4. Monitoring the rate of RTCs over time.

For Time Series Analysis (ARIMA MODEL used TPU [googlecolab] )

We have dataset of Accident and Vehicle and
